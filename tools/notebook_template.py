        "OWL-ViT (Vision Transformer for Open-World Localization) turns a CLIP model into a detector by removing the image tower's "
        "final pooling and attaching a small box head and class head to every output token. At inference the image is resized "
        "to 768×768 **without preserving its aspect ratio and without padding**, and split into 24×24 = 576 patches by the CLIP "
        "ViT-B/32 image tower; each of the caller's phrases is encoded by the CLIP text tower "
        "into one query embedding; every image patch proposes one box and is scored against every query by a **sigmoid** of "
        "the image–text logit; the box survives when its best query score reaches the threshold and is labelled with that "
        "query. The pipeline returns each surviving box in xyxy pixel coordinates of the input image, the phrase it matched, "
        "and its score. **No adaptation occurs:** no training, fine-tuning, in-context conditioning, or preprocessing "
        "fitting happens in this notebook — the upstream checkpoint supplies the weights, processor and tokenizer, and the "
        "carried pipeline module adds snapshot verification, prompt and image validation with named ceilings, a fixed output "
        "contract and the `box_iou`, `validate_inputs` and `evaluation_report` helpers. The default sample is a synthetic "
        "scene drawn in code; the IoU values reported for it are sanity evidence against the boxes you drew, not a benchmark claim."

        "immutable upstream model revision, draw a synthetic scene with known object boxes, validate the image and the "

        "the public API with an explicit caller-owned threshold, read sigmoid scores and the absence of non-maximum "
        "suppression correctly, produce an evaluation report that is `sample-sanity` with `box_iou` only when reference "

The pinned `torch==2.14.0` install and the ~613 MB checkpoint are the large downloads of the run.",

        "- **Data:** the default sample is a deterministic 640×480 scene drawn in code (grey background, a black rectangle, a red disc, a blue triangle) with three prompts naming them, so nothing is downloaded and no private data is needed. Optional BYOD upload is gated off by default so the sample path can run top-to-bottom without interaction. Expected BYOD input: one image file decodable by Pillow (PNG/JPEG/WebP and similar), any colour mode, sides between 16 and 4096 px, plus your own comma-separated prompt phrases (1–16 distinct phrases, at most 48 characters each; the upstream convention is `a photo of a <thing>`). Do not upload confidential or restricted data to a hosted notebook environment unless you are authorized to do so.

        "The boxes are matched to free-text phrases: the label tells you which query the box scored best against, not that the "
        "object is really there, and the sigmoid score is uncalibrated. The threshold is a request parameter you own; the "
        "default is the README usage example, not a tuned operating point. On the synthetic scene the `box_iou` values in the "
        "evaluation report compare detections to shapes you drew yourself and the verdict is `sample-sanity`, which proves only "
        "that the input contract, query formatting, forward pass and coordinate mapping work; they say nothing about "
        "photographs, small or occluded objects, crowded scenes, or vocabulary the model has never seen, and a BYOD result is a "
        "single-image observation with the verdict `not-measurable`. Prompts longer than 16 CLIP tokens are truncated silently, "
        "the image is squashed to 768×768 so a wide or tall image is distorted and each of its 32×32-pixel patches covers a "
        "different share of the scene, and without non-maximum suppression one object can surface as several boxes at a low "
        "threshold. The pipeline provides no "
        "segmentation, tracking, OCR, captioning, mAP evaluation, or training capability.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's pipeline module, carried in this notebook, can "
        "acquire and digest-verify the pinned model, validate the demonstrated request, execute the public pipeline path, and "
        "emit the shown machine-readable outputs in the tested runtime — without the repository being reachable. It does **not** "
        "establish benchmark superiority, deployment calibration, safety for high-consequence decisions, or production fitness on "
        "an unseen domain.\n\n"
        "**Next experiments:** lower `threshold` to 0.05 and count the duplicate boxes; rephrase the prompts in the upstream form (`a photo of a red circle`) and compare scores; add a prompt for "
        "something that is not in the scene (`a green star`) and see whether anything surfaces; enable `USE_BYOD` with a "
        "photograph, hand-label a few objects and pass them to `evaluation_report` to see the verdict switch to `sample-sanity` — "
        "the first step towards a real precision/recall number.\n\n"
